## How We Imagine Poetic Constructions: The Role of Episodic Simulation in Poetry Composition

This repository contains the main code and materials for our study titled "How we imagine poetic constructions: The role of episodic simulation in poetry composition." The study explores how episodic simulation influences the process of poetry composition, shedding light on how episodic simulation contribute to the creative construction of poetic expressions.

### Contents of the Repository

Code: The primary analysis code for both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 is provided, including mixed linear model analyses and statistical summaries.

Materials: Supplementary materials related to the study, excluding video content.

### Note on Supplementary Videos

The video materials used in Experiment 1 for memory induction are not included here due to their large file size. If you are interested in obtaining the supplementary videos, please feel free to contact me directly.
